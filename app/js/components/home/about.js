                            I have more than 20 years of desktop and mobile web
                            development experience involving a wide variety of
                            applications and industries.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While my roots are in design and the user
                            experience, I made a major transition over the years
                            to focus on development. In the beginning this translated
                            to simply being good at html, css and knowing enough
                            jquery to be dangerous. But once the Single Page App
                            craze hit with so many interesting new possibilities
                            on the front end, I decided engineering was my real interest
                            and that it was time to take a deeper dive.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the time since the dust has settled, Iâ€™ve had a
                            chance to work on some great projects on both the
                            enterprise and the startup level. I would love to
                            speak with you about your needs and see how we can
                            work together.
