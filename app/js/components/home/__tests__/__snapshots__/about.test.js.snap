        I have more than 20 years of desktop and mobile web development experience involving a wide variety of applications and industries.
      </p>
      <p>
        While my roots are in design and the user experience, I made a major transition over the years to focus on development. In the beginning this translated to simply being good at html, css and knowing enough jquery to be dangerous. But once the Single Page App craze hit with so many interesting new possibilities on the front end, I decided engineering was my real interest and that it was time to take a deeper dive.

        In the time since the dust has settled, Iâ€™ve had a chance to work on some great projects on both the enterprise and the startup level. I would love to speak with you about your needs and see how we can work together.
